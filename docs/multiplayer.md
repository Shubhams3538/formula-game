# Multiplayer

This implementation is based on upstream PR #2's merged commit
`cea2bc143eea25a0781bf91839ea0f2e97925c0d`. It lives on `feat/multiplayer`.
The frozen custom engine and the unfinished livery branch are excluded.

## Play with friends

Install the **same multiplayer build and converted assets** on every machine.
Before admission the protocol checks a build hash (every `sim` and `net` source file plus
the locked versions of the crates they compute with) and the selected circuit/car
simulation assets (`track.json`, `collision.bin`, `car.json`, and `teams.json` for GEN22).
Visual meshes and textures are not checked; like camera, audio and HUD choices they stay local. Windows, macOS and Linux use the
same protocol; authoritative snapshots correct floating-point differences between platforms.

Build from the repository root:

```sh
cargo build --release --locked --workspace
```

Host, including the hosting player in the 16-player limit:

```sh
./target/release/f1-the-game --assets ./assets --car rb6 --host 7777 --name Alice --ai-cars 6
```

Join from another computer, replacing the address with the host's LAN or VPN IP:

```sh
./target/release/f1-the-game --assets ./assets --car rb6 --join 192.168.1.20:7777 --name Bob
```

On Windows use `target\release\f1-the-game.exe` with the same options. `--car gen22`
is also supported when the updated stock GEN22 assets, rig, teams and textures from
PR #2 are installed. The older RB22 asset directory cannot substitute for GEN22.

For the graphical flow, launch normally and choose **Multiplayer**, enter a unique
driver name, then **Host room** or **Join room**. Before creating the room, select
its circuit in Race setup and its car in Multiplayer. The owner can reorder the human grid and set laps,
an exact AI-car count (0–15, within the 16-car field limit), wing setup, tyres,
automatic gears, driving aid strength and DRS rules.
Aids can be locked for everyone or use each player's aids selected before joining.
DRS Anywhere remains an owner-controlled rule in both modes.

GEN22 players can select a stock team/driver or let the room assign a free driver.
The server rejects duplicate driver identities and sends one roster to every client.

Every player clicks **Ready**. The owner clicks **Start race**. In the lobby the owner can
set **AI cars** from 0 to the remaining available slots; that number is exact, rather than
automatically filling every spare slot. Readiness is cleared
when the owner changes rules. Everyone loads the same grid before the server runs
the countdown. No one may join after loading starts. Changing the circuit or car
requires creating a new room. Maximum field size is 16, including AI fill.

During the race, Esc opens the room menu while the shared race continues. Your car
brakes gently while the menu is open or the window is unfocused. R requests server
recovery; manual gear shifts and recovery have reliable sequence numbers. Local
camera keys, M and presentation settings stay local.

A disconnected guest's car becomes AI-controlled. Rejoining that running race is
not supported. If the hosting player leaves, everyone receives a terminated-session
message. A join that is refused (name or GEN22 driver already taken, room full,
different build or assets) is told why straight away rather than timing out.
At results, the owner can return everyone to the lobby and start another race.
Leaving a hosted room stops and joins its server worker.

## Render hosting

The same game client can join a Render-hosted dedicated server with
`--join wss://your-service.onrender.com`, or by entering that URL in Multiplayer.
Build clients and server from the same source revision. See [Render deployment](render.md)
for server assets, container setup, costs, health checks and deployment verification.
Steam and Spacewar are not required. UDP LAN hosting remains available.

## LAN and internet connectivity

Allow incoming **UDP port 7777** on the hosting computer. Manual joining remains
available without discovery or platform accounts. UDP accepts both IPv4 and IPv6 numeric
addresses; IPv6 join addresses use `[address]:7777`. Hosting from the
menu listens on both IPv6 and IPv4 where the OS allows it, and falls back to IPv4 only.

For UDP play between separate networks, use a VPN connecting the computers, or forward
the UDP port on the host's router and share its reachable public address. There is
no NAT traversal, relay, matchmaking or room-code service in this implementation.
Do not expect two computers behind unrelated NATs to connect without one of these
routes. This is a friends-only, unauthenticated room service; it is not a ranked
anti-cheat or identity system.

A Linux, Windows or macOS machine can also run the headless server:

```sh
./target/release/racecraft-server --assets ./assets --bind 0.0.0.0:7777
```

The first admitted player owns a dedicated-server room. When the owner leaves,
ownership passes to the next connected driver; when everyone has left, the room
resets to an empty lobby. A room that closes (overload, load timeout) is replaced
by a fresh one on the same port, so the process keeps serving. Use `--bind [::]:7777`
to accept IPv6 and IPv4. An optional `--settings rules.json` reads a serialized `RaceSettings`. The server needs track collision,
centerline and car geometry assets, and hashes the same selected asset directories
as the clients. It does not link Bevy or require a display, sound device or GPU.
The same UDP process can run on a reachable VPS. A Render WebSocket deployment configuration is also included; see [Render hosting](render.md).

## Native packages

Run this on each destination OS:

```sh
python3 tools/package/build_multiplayer.py --assets ./assets --car rb6
```

The ZIP contains the game, dedicated server, selected assets, a launcher and these
instructions. Omitting `--assets` produces a binary-only package whose recipient
must install the matching assets separately. The workflow
`.github/workflows/multiplayer.yml` checks and builds all three operating systems;
its artifacts omit generated assets. A workflow definition is not evidence of a
successful remote build. Linux packages require system GPU/window/audio libraries;
this ZIP script does not replace the upstream Linux AppImage builder. macOS ZIPs
are native executables with a `.command` launcher, not signed/notarized apps.

## Simulation and network contracts

- The host owns one `Race` at `sim::PHYSICS_RATE` (360 Hz). Hosting players join
  through the same UDP client path as guests. Inputs target explicit server ticks.
- Clients keep a predicted full race. The lead is 12 ticks (33 ms) plus half the
  round trip. A surplus lead (after a latency spike) is bled off by holding about one
  predicted tick in sixteen, so it cannot stay inflated. Prediction stops at a 90-tick
  lead during packet gaps; it cannot extrapolate indefinitely.
- Snapshots fall on every 12th tick. On those ticks the server and every client round
  race state to the wire precision, so both continue from bit-identical state. When a
  snapshot matches the client's own prediction exactly (same inputs), the client keeps
  its state and skips the rollback and replay; otherwise it restores and replays.
- Held input batches go at 60 Hz, repeating up to 36 recent physics samples as packed
  integers (about 9 bytes each). Clients predict with the same packed values the server
  simulates. The server ignores past/duplicate ticks and rejects inputs more than 90
  ticks into its future and malformed controls. Each batch also acknowledges the
  newest snapshot the client holds.
- Shifts and recovery use a separate ordered reliable channel, monotonically
  increasing command IDs and authoritative snapshot acknowledgements. A repeated
  command ID cannot shift or recover the car twice. At most one command per car
  is consumed on each physics tick.
- Complete mutable snapshots include timing, race order, RNG, DRS, tyres,
  suspension and AI decision state. Immutable specs and large AI track planning
  caches remain local. Remote humans predict their last authoritative controls.
- Snapshots go at 30 Hz over Renet's unreliable fragmented channel. Floating-point
  state travels as `f32` in its own stream; race time, lap timing, car setup and aids
  and AI plan inputs stay exact. Each snapshot is an XOR delta against the newest one the
  client acknowledged (full when that is unavailable), then compressed. With 16 cars
  racing that averages about 3 KB instead of about 7.4 KB. Messages have a 64 KiB decoded size limit. Renet
  fragments below its UDP packet limit. Incomplete fragment storage is bounded
  at 8 MiB per channel, enough for three seconds of worst-size snapshots. Newer
  snapshots supersede older ones by server tick. Render corrections blend for
  100 ms without changing the corrected simulation state; recoveries snap.
- Lobby/load messages, numbered race events and final results use ordered reliable
  delivery. Events are batched with each snapshot; repeated contact reports for the
  same pair within a batch collapse into the hardest one. Events have bounded retention
  and are deduplicated before the HUD.
- Admission/load deadlines, bounded queues, per-client message budgets and an
  eight-second silence timeout keep abandoned sessions from living indefinitely.
  Unadmitted clients receive no race state. A 30-second load deadline ends the
  room if a connected participant cannot finish loading.
- The server bounds catch-up work at 36 physics steps per update and ends a room
  with a clear overload message if simulation debt exceeds half a second. It does
  not silently skip physics time to conceal sustained overload.

## Verification

```sh
cargo test --workspace --lib --bins
cargo test -p racecraft-net --test lifecycle -- --nocapture
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo run --release -p racecraft-net --example soak -- ./assets 15
```

The network integration suite uses real loopback UDP sockets, 16 **scripted**
clients, deterministic 5% datagram loss, duplication every 31st datagram and
three-tick delay/reordering every seventh datagram. It checks fresh authority,
unique slot assignment, snapshot replay, delta snapshots, exact-prediction skips,
disconnect takeover and malformed frames. Additional lifecycle checks cover owner
permissions, reliable command deduplication, finish results, returning for another race,
hosted-room closure, dedicated-room hand-over and reset, immediate join refusal, the
asset fingerprint scope and IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack admission. The soak uses the real converted
Spa/RB6 assets and a separately scheduled server, but has no renderer or human input.

Recorded checks and runtime limitations are reported with the delivery. Scripted
loopback capacity, a native build, and two people driving on separate computers
are different acceptance boundaries. Two-computer LAN driving, all-platform runtime
interop, long-distance latency and an externally deployed server require their own
validation; do not infer them from the integration suite.
